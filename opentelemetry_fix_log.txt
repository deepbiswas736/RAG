Troubleshooting OpenTelemetry Issues Log:

Initial Status (2025-05-21):
- OpenTelemetry dependencies installed via requirements.txt for all relevant services.
- Persistent import errors for opentelemetry packages (e.g., opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc.log_exporter) in multiple services.
- kafka_utility import error in llm-service.

Next Steps:
1. Investigate kafka_utility import error in llm-service.
2. Investigate OpenTelemetry import errors.

[2025-05-21 Session Start]
Attempting to resolve import errors for OpenTelemetry and kafka_utility.
Initial focus: e:\code\experimental\RAG\microservices\llm-service\app\main.py

Plan:
1. Investigate kafka_utility import: Check for and create missing __init__.py files.
2. Re-check errors in llm-service.
3. Systematically address OpenTelemetry import errors if they persist.

[2025-05-21 10:00]
Modified e:\code\experimental\RAG\microservices\llm-service\app\main.py:
- Removed sys.path manipulation for kafka_utility import.
- Relied on standard import for kafka_utility.app.infrastructure.adapters.consumer_debug.
- OpenTelemetry import errors (e.g., opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc.log_exporter) still persist after this change.

Next steps:
- Further investigate Python environment for llm-service if OTEL errors continue.

[Persistent Issue] OpenTelemetry import errors ("Import ... could not be resolved") continue in all main.py files even after confirming successful pip installation of dependencies.
Hypothesis: The Python interpreter/environment used by the linter/editor might not be correctly recognizing the newly installed packages, or the linter needs a restart/refresh.
Next Steps: Will advise user to check interpreter settings in VS Code and potentially restart the Python Language Server or VS Code.
